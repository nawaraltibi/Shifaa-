## Project Overview

Shifaa is a comprehensive mobile application designed to streamline patient-doctor interactions, appointment management, and secure communication within a medical center. Built with Flutter and architected using Clean Architecture principles, the application provides a robust, scalable, and maintainable solution for healthcare management. The app ensures patient data privacy through end-to-end encryption, offers offline capabilities for seamless user experience, and implements real-time communication features for instant updates and messaging.

## Key Features

- **Secure Real-Time Chat:** Implemented end-to-end encrypted chat using `Pusher Channels`, with secure RSA-OAEP key exchange and `AES-GCM` message encryption to ensure patient data privacy. Each device generates unique RSA key pairs (2048-bit) stored securely via `flutter_secure_storage`, with AES keys encrypted per recipient device using RSA-OAEP padding.

- **Complete Appointment Management:** Built a full booking flow (book/reschedule/cancel) using `BLoC/Cubit` for state management. The system handles appointment scheduling with doctor availability checks, supports rescheduling with conflict detection, and provides cancellation workflows with proper state synchronization across the application.

- **Offline Capability:** Utilized `SQLite` (via `sqflite`) for local data caching, allowing users to access appointment information offline and ensuring seamless synchronization with the backend when connectivity is restored. The repository pattern implements a cache-first strategy with network fallback, providing instant data access while maintaining data consistency.

- **Secure Authentication & Session Management:** Designed a secure auth flow with token lifecycle management using `Dio Interceptors` and secure credential storage via `flutter_secure_storage`. The system implements OTP-based authentication with two-factor authentication support, automatic token injection for authenticated requests, and secure session persistence across app restarts.

- **Centralized & Resilient API Layer:** Architected a robust API layer using `Dio` with interceptors for automatic token injection, request/response logging, and unified error handling. The implementation includes network connectivity checks, retry mechanisms, and comprehensive error mapping to user-friendly messages, ensuring reliable communication with the backend.

- **Push Notifications:** Integrated `Pusher Beams` for instant notifications about appointment updates and incoming messages, with both foreground and background handling. The notification service implements user-specific device interests, secure authentication with the backend, and proper state management for notification preferences.

## Architecture

The project is architected using **Clean Architecture**, emphasizing the separation of concerns and dependency inversion. This structure resulted in a highly modular and testable codebase across **237+ Dart files**.

### State Management

The application uses **BLoC (Business Logic Component)** and **Cubit** patterns via the `flutter_bloc` package for predictable state management. This approach ensures:

- Unidirectional data flow
- Testable business logic
- Clear separation between UI and business logic
- Reactive UI updates based on state changes
